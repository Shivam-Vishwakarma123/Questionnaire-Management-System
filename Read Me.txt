A questionnaire management system using Core PHP with the following features:

Back-end:

1. Admin Login: An authentication system that allows only authorized personnel to access the system.
2. User Module: A module that allows the administrator to manage user accounts, including create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations.
3. Question Master: A module that allows the administrator to add questionnaires.

Front-end:

1. User Register: A module that allows users to register for an account in the system.
2. User Questionnaires: A module that displays a single question to the user at a time and allows the user to submit an answer. 
   The system should be able to track the user's progress and store their responses.
3. User Scorecard: A module that displays the user's score or performance in the questionnaire.
4. User List: A module that allows the administrator to view a list of registered users.
5. User Detail Update: A module that allows users to update their personal information, such as their name and email address.

To implement this system using Core PHP, the following steps can be taken:

a. Design the database schema to store user information, questionnaires, and responses.
b. Develop the user interface using HTML/CSS/JavaScript and Bootstrap framework for a responsive design.
c. Implement the back-end using Core PHP to handle user authentication and database CRUD operations.
d. Deploy the system to a production server and monitor its performance and user feedback for further improvements.

In conclusion, a questionnaire management system using Core PHP can be a powerful tool for managing user feedback and performance metrics. 
By implementing the above features, the system can provide valuable insights for organizations and individuals looking to improve their products or services.
